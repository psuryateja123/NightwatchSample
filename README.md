# NightwatchSample
Its my implementation for the nightwatch using JavaSript
I have used the page object model (pom as the folder in the project). This helps to maintain the project structure more effectively. In the pom folder, contains the pages of the web page, that each Javascript file that represents the page contains the object of individual pages and they are maintained as modules. By maintaining them as modules, helps to drive the regression and the smoke tests effectively. To make this more effective we can add another layer as locators and put all the locators in the folder.
